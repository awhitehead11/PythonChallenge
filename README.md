# PythonChallenge

I was tripping over myself trying to replace existing text to match the new goals, so I decided to write the code from a blank slate. It wasn't until very late in the steps that I realized we would also want to be able to provide candidate data as well, so I SHOULD have left the original code in. Now we're at the buzzer, so going to submit what I have and take another crack at it tomorrow.
